`arubi` from #bitcoin-dev

    10:44 <arubi> jb55, awesome. for my serializer, I also defined a few "make
    your life easy" templates, like plain numbers are treated as scriptnum (need
    to be valid), the character @ means minimal push, so something like @<hex
    pubkey> is converted to 0x21 0x<pubkey> (and longer pushes if needed), a
    0x<hex> is just treated like literal serialized part of the script.. you're
    probably already on it, but just my pov :)

Some things to consider

- [ ] May need context for things like CSV
- [ ] Should we represent context as the program environment?
- [ ] Pure environment and perhaps live testnet environment?
- [ ] How to do this?
